##################################
2.2 release notes (IN DEVELOPMENT)
##################################

*****************
What's new in 2.2
*****************

``django-mptt`` now a proper dependency
=======================================

`django-mptt`_ is now used as a
proper dependency and is now longer shipped with the django CMS. This solves the
version conflict issues many people had when trying to use the django CMS
together with other Django apps that require django-mptt. django CMS 2.2
requires django-mptt 0.4.2 or higher.

.. warning::

    Please remove the old ``mptt`` package from your Python site-packages
    directory before upgrading. The ``setup.py`` file will install the
    `django-mptt`_ package as an external dependency!

******************************
Backwards incompatible changes
******************************

``django-sekizai`` instead of PluginMedia
=========================================

Due to the sorry state of the old plugin media framework, it has been dropped in
favor of the more stable and more flexible django-sekizai, which is a new
dependency for the django CMS 2.2.

The following methods and properties of :class:`cms.plugins_base.CMSPluginBase`
are affected:

* :class:`cms.plugins_base.CMSPluginBase.PluginMedia`
* :attr:`cms.plugins_base.CMSPluginBase.pluginmedia`
* :meth:`cms.plugins_base.CMSPluginBase.get_plugin_media`

Accessing :attr:`cms.plugins_base.CMSPluginBase.pluginmedia` or
:meth:`cms.plugins_base.CMSPluginBase.get_plugin_media` will raise a
:exc:`cms.exceptions.Deprecated` exception.

The :class:`cms.middleware.media.PlaceholderMediaMiddleware` middleware was also
removed in this process and is therefore no longer required, however you now
require to have the ``'sekizai.context_processors.sekizai'`` context processor
in your :setting:`django:TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS` setting.

All templates in :setting:`CMS_TEMPLATES` must contain at least the ``js`` and
``css`` sekizai namespaces.

Please refer to the documentation on :ref:`custom-plugins-handling-media` in
custom CMS plugins and the
`django-sekizai documentation <http://django-sekizai.readthedocs.org/>`_ for
more information.


Toolbar must be enabled explicitly in templates
===============================================

The toolbar no longer hacks itself into responses in the middleware, but rather
has to be enabled explictely using the ``{% cms_toolbar %}`` template tag from
the ``cms_tags`` template tag library in your templates. The template tag
should be placed somewhere within the body of the HTML (within ``<body>...</body>``).

This solves issues people where having with the toolbar showing up in places it
shouldn't.


**************************
Features deprecated in 2.2
**************************

``django-dbgettext`` support
============================

The django-dbgettext support has been fully dropped in 2.2 in favor of the
built-in mechanisms to achieve multilinguality.
